Hi, I'm Dan. I'm currently the Technical Director at a major software development bootcamp in the UK. Public repositories here are for coaching purposes

I mostly work with JS (React + Node) & Golang. Sometimes Swift. Sometimes Python. Sometimes Dotnet 5. I spend a lot of my time configuring serverless solutions on AWS, even though I'd probably prefer to be doing it on GCP ðŸ˜†

I'm a massive supporter of knowledge sharing and technical communication.
