Hi, I'm Dan. I'm currently the Technical Director at a major Software Development bootcamp in the UK. I try to split my time evenly between building cool shit and mentoring junior developers.

I mostly work with JS (React + Node) & Golang. Sometimes Swift. Sometimes Python (for ML, not webdev). Sometimes dotnet core. I spend a lot of my time configuring serverless solutions on AWS, even though I'd probably prefer to be doing it on GCP ðŸ˜†

I'm a massive supporter of knowledge sharing and technical communication. Most of the public repositories here are for coaching purposes.
